# Continual Learning for Low-Resource Natural Language Processing

This repository contains the code for the study on continual learning for low-resource NLP. (work in progress, and will release the code)

## Dataset

The datasets are available from [here](http://goo.gl/JyCnZq) and are from the paper titled "*[Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2015/file/250cf8b51c773f3f8dc8b4be867a9a02-Paper.pdf)*". Please refer to the paper for more details on the dataset.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stellaho/low_resource_continual_learning.git

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Downloading the data

1. Create a directory for storing the data: `mkdir data`.

2. Navigate to the data directory: `cd data`.
